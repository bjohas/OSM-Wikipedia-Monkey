# OSM-Wikipedia-Monkey

Two tampermonkey scripts to go between OSM and Wikipedia.

The Wikipedia->OSM script works reasonably well.

The OSM->Wikipedia script doesn't. The main issue is that you need to reload the page to see refreshed results.

See http://bjohas.de/wiki/Maps/Linking_wikipedia_to_OSM for background and related projects.

Wikipedia Gadget version also here https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Bjohas/OSMgadget.

Do contribute :)
